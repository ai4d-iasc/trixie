# Overview

It is possible to retrieve data from automatically generated filesystem backups. The IBM Spectrum Scale (GPFS) system includes the ability to create filesystem snapshots which create temporary backups of data stored in the filesystem. These snapshots can be accessed to retrieve files that may have been accidentally removed.

Please see the [GPFS Snapshot document](files/gpfs-snapshots.pdf "GPFS Snapshots") for more details on how to retrieve files from the backups.
