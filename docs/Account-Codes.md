# Account Codes

In order to run jobs on Trixie, users need to specify which SLURM Account Code should be used for
tracking purposes and possibly billing. This is handled by adding a line in the SLURM submission
script which identifies the account.

```
SBATCH --account=account_code
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Users must be authorized to charge an account before they can use it.

## Projects

Projects are typically designated for a fixed period of time and are associated with projects
