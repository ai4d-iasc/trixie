# External HPC Systems

## Overview

There may be instances where researchers require connectivity to external HPC systems from Trixie. However, network access to and from Trixie is restricted to maintain a high level of security. Therefore, connections to external systems need to be approved before the connection can be opened.

This page provides instructions for requesting a connection to an external system, as well as a list of approved systems that already have an open connection.

## Request a Connection to an External System

In order to submit a request to open a network flow between Trixie and an external HPC system, please post your request in [the issues section](https://github.com/ai4d-iasc/trixie/issues) of this site.
